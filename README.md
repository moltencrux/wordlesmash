## Usage

### Graphical User Interface

To use Word Le SMASH! via the graphical user interface:

1. Enter your chosen word into the input boxes, duplicating the word you chose in your actual game.
2. Click each box to cycle through the color clues, matching the colors from your actual game:
   - **Black/Gray**: Not in the word
   - **Yellow**: In the word, but not in the correct position
   - **Green**: In the word and in the correct position
3. After entering the color clues, the application will generate a new pick and display a list of all possible remaining solutions.
4. Repeat steps 1â€“3 until you've solved the puzzle.

**Note**: By following the strategy recommended by Word Le SMASH!, you can expect to solve the puzzle within 4 guesses with a ~99% success rate. Running out of guesses is highly unlikely, allowing you to solve the puzzle quickly and efficiently.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyQT 6
- NumPy (`numpy`)
